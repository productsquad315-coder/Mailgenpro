# HUMAN WRITING SOPs: THE "IRONCLAD" STANDARD (NUCLEAR GRADE)

> [!URGENT]
> **OBJECTIVE**: To create email content that creates **Intellectual Curiosity**, not "Marketing Hype".
> **PASS/FAIL**: If the recipient knows it's a mass email within 0.5 seconds, the email is TRASH.

## 1. THE "KILL SWITCH" LIST (INSTANT FAIL)

**If an email contains ANY of these, it must be DELETED immediately.**

### The "Sales Breath" Markers
- ❌ **Any Greeting requiring mental energy**: "I hope you are well", "Happy Monday", "Trust you're thriving".
    - *Correction*: Start with the recipient's name or jump straight to context.
- ❌ **Apologies**: "Sorry to intrude", "Pardon the interruption". (Subservient = Spam).
- ❌ **Fake Familiarity**: "I loved your recent post on LinkedIn" (unless followed by a *specific* quote from that post).
- ❌ **"Get Started" Buttons**: Big colored buttons.
    - *Correction*: Use text links: "Link to start" or "More info here".

### The "Adjective Purge"
- **Rule**: Banish 90% of adjectives. Adjectives are where lies hide.
    - ❌ "Our *comprehensive*, *powerful* dashboard..."
    - ✅ "Our dashboard..."
    - ❌ "We drive *significant* ROI."
    - ✅ "We increased revenue by 12%."

## 2. THE "BAR TEST" (TONE CHECK)

**The Rule**: Read the email out loud. Imagine you are saying it to a friend at a bar.
- If they would punch you for sounding like a brochure, **REWRITE IT**.
- If it sounds like normal human speech, **KEEP IT**.

**Examples**:
- ❌ "We specialize in leveraging synergies to optimize outcomes." (Punchable)
- ✅ "We help you stop wasting money on ads that don't convert." (Human)

## 3. STRUCTURAL MIMICRY: THE "BUSY HUMAN" PROTOCOL

Humans are busy. Robots are verbose.

### A. The "F-Pattern" Layout
- No paragraph should exceed **2 lines** on a mobile screen.
- Use **bullets** or **dashes** for lists (max 3 items).

### B. "Liquid Syntax" (Anti-Template)
- **Variation #1**: Start with a lowercase letter? (Risky but authentic "tech" vibe).
    - `Subject: question about [Company]`
- **Variation #2**: The "Sent from iPhone" typo (Optional).
    - Leaving a minor, non-critical grammar quirk makes it feel hand-typed.
- **Variation #3**: The "Double Tap".
    - Sending a 2nd email 1 minute later: "Forgot the link: [Link]" (High open rate tactic).

## 4. THE CTA STRATEGY: "GET STARTED" WITHOUT THE SPAM

You want them to "Get Started". But a "Get Started" button is a spam flag.

### The "Permission Loop" (Safest)
Don't shove the marriage proposal (Get Started) in the first date (First Email).
- **Goal**: Get a REPLY first.
- **Why**: A reply whitelist's you forever.
- **Copy**:
    - "If this sounds relevant, reply 'Yes' and I'll send the setup guide."
    - "Worth a 5-min look?"
    - "Opposed to seeing how it works?"

### The "Soft Link" (If you MUST link)
If you must link directly to the app:
- **Rule**: Put the link in the **P.S.** or **Signature**.
- **Copy**:
    - "P.S. You can try it here: [Link]"
    - "Signature: Vijay, Founder @ MailGenPro (Try it free: [Link])"

## 5. FINAL QUALITY CONTROL: THE "WHO CARES?" TEST

Before pressing send, ask: **"So what?"**
- "We have a new AI feature." -> **So what?**
- "It writes emails faster." -> **So what?**
- "You save 10 hours a week." -> **APPROVED.**

Always write the **"So What?"** (The Benefit), never just the **"What"** (The Feature).
